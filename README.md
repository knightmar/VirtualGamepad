# Virtual Gamepad 
This project is mainly a training project, it will allow you to connect your phone to a computer as a usb gamepad. 

I'm using some tools for this project : 
  - Jetbrains's RustRover
  - Git + Github
  - The crate [vigem client](https://docs.rs/vigem-client/0.1.4/vigem_client/) used to create a virtual gamepad on windows.


# How to use the project ??
First, install the [ViGEmBus driver](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/tag/v1.22.0)  
Then, clone my project (or get a release)  
And run : `cargo run`  

I'm open to any feedback, so let me know if you like this project or if somethings looks wrong in my code ðŸ˜‰
